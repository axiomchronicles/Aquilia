## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security is a high priority for the Aquilia and its community. If you discover a security vulnerability in Aquilia, please adhere to the following guidelines:

1. **Do NOT open a public issue.** This gives attackers an opportunity to exploit the vulnerability before an official patch is released.
2. Please send an email to the project maintainers outlining the vulnerability context and potential steps to reproduce.
3. We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report as soon as possible and strive to send you regular updates about our progress.
4. Once the issue has been resolved and a new release is available, we will announce the fix publicly and give you credit for the discovery (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).

### Scope
This policy applies to all core components included in the `aquilia` distribution package. If the vulnerability affects a third-party module or dependency, you should report it directly to that upstream project, but notifying us is still appreciated so we can update our dependencies as well.
